        <p class="lead">Hannah Arendt was a German-born American political philosopher.</p> 
        <p>
          Her many books and articles have had a lasting influence on political 
          theory and philosophy. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important 
          political thinkers of the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arendt was born in Linden in 1906, to a Jewish family. At the age of three, 
          her family moved to Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia, so that her 
          father's syphilis could be treated. Paul Arendt had contracted the disease 
          in his youth, and it was thought to be in remission when Arendt was born. 
          He died when she was seven. Arendt was raised in a politically progressive, 
          secular family. Her mother was an ardent supporter of the Social Democrats. 
          After completing her secondary education in Berlin, she studied at the 
          University of Marburg under Martin Heidegger, with whom she had a brief affair. 
          She obtained her doctorate in philosophy writing on Love and Saint Augustine 
          at the University of Heidelberg in 1929 under the direction of the existentialist 
          philosopher, Karl Jaspers.
        </p>

          Hannah Arendt married Günther Stern in 1929, but soon began to encounter 
          increasing antisemitism in 1930s Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, 
          and while researching antisemitic propaganda for the Zionist Federation of Germany 
          in Berlin that year, Arendt was arrested for collected antisemitic research at the 
          Prussian State Library and briefly imprisoned by the Gestapo. On release, she fled 
          Germany, living in Czechoslovakia and Switzerland before settling in Paris. There 
          she worked for Youth Aliyah, assisting young Jews to emigrate to British Mandate of 
          Palestine (now Israel). Divorcing Stern in 1937, she married Heinrich Blücher in 1940, 
          but when Germany invaded France in 1940 she was detained by the French as an alien, 
          despite having been stripped of her German citizenship in 1937. She escaped and made 
          her way to the United States in 1941 via Portugal. She settled in New York, which 
          remained her principal residence for the rest of her life. She became a writer and 
          editor and worked for the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, becoming an American citizen 
          in 1950. With the publication of The Origins of Totalitarianism in 1951, her reputation 
          as a thinker and writer was established and a series of works followed. These included 
          the books The Human Condition in 1958, as well as Eichmann in Jerusalem and On Revolution 
          in 1963. She taught at many American universities, while declining tenure-track appointments. 
          She died suddenly of a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 69, leaving her last work, 
          The Life of the Mind, unfinished.

          Her works cover a broad range of topics, but she is best known for those dealing with the 
          nature of power and evil, as well as politics, direct democracy, authority, and totalitarianism. 
          In the popular mind she is best remembered for the controversy surrounding the trial of Adolf 
          Eichmann, her attempt to explain how ordinary people become actors in totalitarian systems, 
          which was considered by some an apologia, and for the phrase "the banality of evil". She is 
          commemorated by institutions and journals devoted to her thinking, the Hannah Arendt Prize for 
          political thinking, and on stamps, street names and schools, amongst other things.

                  <p class="card-text">Arendt's doctoral thesis was published in 1929 and attracted critical interest, 
                    although an English translation did not appear until 1996. Arendt's interpretation of love in the 
                    work of Augustine deals with three concepts, love as craving or desire, love in the relationship 
                    between man and creator, and neighborly love. Love as craving anticipates the future, while love 
                    for the Creator deals with the remembered past. Of the three, neighborly love is perceived as the most 
                    fundamental, to which the first two are oriented, which she treats under social life, the second of 
                    the Great Commandments, "Love your neighbor as yourself", uniting and transcending the former.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Arendt's first major book examined the roots of Communism and Nazism, structured as three essays, 
                    "Antisemitism", "Imperialism" and "Totalitarianism". Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a 
                    "novel form of government," that "differs essentially from other forms of political oppression 
                    known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship" in that it applied terror to subjugate 
                    mass populations rather than just political adversaries. Criticism included the interpretation 
                    that the two movements were portrayed as equally tyrannical. Arendt also maintained that Jewry 
                    was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy because Nazism was 
                    about terror and consistency, not merely eradicating Jews. Arendt explained the tyranny using 
                    Kant's phrase "Radical Evil", by which their victims became "Superfluous People". In later editions 
                    she enlarged the text to include her work on "Ideology and Terror: A novel form of government" and 
                    the Hungarian Revolution, but then published the latter separately.
